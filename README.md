# E-Commerce

This week's challenge was to use provided, working code, and fill in the necessary blanks to create tables, and also to connect/create a sequelize database.

The idea was to connect the (almost) finished front end, and build the back end database, connect the two, and then use Insomnia or Postman to show that the CRUD operations worked.

In my case I used Postman, since that's what we use in class.

Here is the screenshot for this project:

# Challenges
I used the Xpert Learning Assistant supplied with the bootcamp to assist with certain layouts, so that they were set up correctly.  It also helped me with debugging, which was great as I could do this on my own time without working around a tutor's schedule (which is fine most of the time, but sometimes I want answers instantly!)
